# Open questions

Questions the project description ([README.md](../README.md)) leaves open. Each has a proposed default. Once a
question is answered, move the decision into the relevant document and remove it here.

## Philips Hue (after the MVP)

| ID   | Question | Proposed default |
|------|----------|------------------|
| Q-H4 | The bridge limits the transition time of a recall. Is that enough for long ramps (e.g. 30 min), or does the app have to step the brightness itself? | Test against the bridge during implementation; step manually only if needed. |
| Q-H5 | A second, silent alarm turns the light off, but every event in the alarm calendar is a normal alarm and event fields carry no format. How is a silent alarm marked? | A second calendar, chosen in the Hue settings, whose events only turn the light off. This keeps the rule that titles and descriptions have no format. |
